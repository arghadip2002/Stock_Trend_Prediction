### Stock_Trend_Prediction

It is a Machine Learning Model that Predicts the Closing Prices of Stocks. I have uses Sequential and LSTM with 'adam' optimizer and 'mean_squared_error' as loss factor to create this model.

Then I have used streamlit to make a web application and integrated the model in it.

Technologies Used : Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit, Python, Tensorflow, Keras (Sequential, LSTM)
